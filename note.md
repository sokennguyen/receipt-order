- 2 "other" orders are on the same line right now, not good.
- separate menu from data.py to a constant, editable file.
- go through all the menu, figure out what items are missing, what are the aliases, what are default notes and unique notes for each items, and what to print.
- "more more" right now only print one "+". I think other things are like that also
